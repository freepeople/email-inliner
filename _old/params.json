Both GMail and Outlook are notorious for this. As a brand that sends many merchandising e-mails per week, this is a major nuisance, as having to in-line all of our e-mail HTML by hand is time consuming and tedious.\r\n\r\nWe shopped around to find an HTML E-mail In-liner that we could use to make life a bit easier when creating these e-mails. Though we found a few good ones, they were all server-side. Feeling adventurous, we decided to build a client-side in-liner as a goof. This is what you see before you.\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nTo use this in-liner, paste your HTML (with the STYLE tags still in the HEAD section) and click \"Make Magic.\" \r\n\r\nWithin a few seconds, the styles from your head will be added inline to the appropriate HTML elements in the body of your document. \r\n\r\nJust grab the newly in-lined code from the second TEXTAREA and replace your original email HTML with that, and voila! You no longer have to worry about any e-mail providers removing the styles from your HEAD and ruining the look of your e-mail!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
