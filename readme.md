### About
Many e-mail providers will remove the STYLE tags from the HEAD section of an e-mail. Both GMail and Outlook are notorious for this. As a brand that sends many merchandising e-mails per week, this is a major nuisance, as having to in-line all of our e-mail HTML by hand is time consuming and tedious.

We shopped around to find an HTML E-mail In-liner that we could use to make life a bit easier when creating these e-mails. Though we found a few good ones, they were all server-side. Feeling adventurous, we decided to build a client-side in-liner as a goof. This is what you see before you.

### Usage
To use this in-liner, paste your HTML (with the STYLE tags still in the HEAD section) and click "Make Magic." 

Within a few seconds, the styles from your head will be added inline to the appropriate HTML elements in the body of your document. 

Just grab the newly in-lined code from the second TEXTAREA and replace your original email HTML with that, and voila! You no longer have to worry about any e-mail providers removing the styles from your HEAD and ruining the look of your e-mail!
